The files contained in this repository are intended to "solve" the problems asigned to Mr. Howard's 2014-2015 CVGS Computer Science course.

The files are not always very descripively named and that's just too bad, if you want better names, send me a nice e-mail or go cry into a pillow.

Computer Science Students: copying or otherwise directly using this code in full or in part and presenting it as your own work, or even with atribution, constitutes a violation of the honor code and is not my responsibility.

Everyone else: do what you want with my programs, but some attribution would be great.
